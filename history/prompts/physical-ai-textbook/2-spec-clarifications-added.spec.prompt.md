## User Input
```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response
Added five key clarifications to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook specification:

1. Authorization levels for different user types (students, educators, developers)
2. Specific performance requirements (<3s load time, 99.9% uptime, etc.)
3. Comprehensive security and privacy measures
4. External service integrations (CDN, cloud platform, analytics)
5. Accessibility requirements (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)

## Summary
Successfully enhanced the feature specification with detailed clarifications across multiple critical areas: user authorization, performance requirements, security measures, external dependencies, and accessibility standards. The updated specification now provides clear, measurable requirements for development and validation.
